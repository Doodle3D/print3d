PRINT3D README

This package provides access to multiple types of 3D printers. It aims to be usable at least on
OSX and Openwrt (linux) and currently provides a command-line frontend and a lua binding.

C++ unit tests use Fructose 1.2.0 (http://fructose.sourceforge.net/).


HOW TO BUILD

This package is intended to be built either for embedded devices using the Openwrt build system or natively using CMake.
Building natively is done using the script `build-local.sh` (or manually). The included Eclipse CDT project also has the necessary targets configured.

Requirements to build and run the code natively are: cmake (more to come).
