HOW TO BUILD

This package is intended to be built either for embedded devices using the Openwrt build system or natively using CMake.
Building natively is done using the script `build-local.sh` (or manually). The included Eclipse CDT project also has the necessary targets configured.

Requirements to build and run the code natively are: cmake (more to come).
